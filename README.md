# latte_order_program
A program which displays the required ingredients based on an order plus some extras.

This is a small practice project made during my learning on codex.io.

## What it does

The program asks for a latte type and outputs the required ingredients.  
It includes logic for:
- Extra vanilla pumps (costs more)
- Multiple items â†’ customers get a tray

## Technologies used
- Java

## What I learned
- Basic input/output
- Conditional logic
- Thinking in steps like a real order process
